      I'm Wagner, a full stack web developer with a love for coding and
      problem-solving. I'm a student in Computer Science from Est√°cio. My
      journey into web development started with a fascination for how websites
      work, which led me to master technologies like ReactJS, NextJS, CSS,
      TypeScript, and backend frameworks like Node.js and Express. When I'm not
      coding, you can find me training Jiu Jitsu, reading, or playing DotA.
